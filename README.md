# Word-Guess-Game
Game utilizing javascript events where users guess a word.

This game is essentially a "Hangman" game in which the user tries to guess the letters of a word that the computer has selected.  The user has a limited number of wrong guesses and the user wins if they are able to guess all letters without guessing incorrectly too many times.  If the user wins, a jet flies across the screen.  If the user loses, the jet crashes into the ground.

The animations for this game were created by recursively calling the setTimeout method within specific functions.  This delayed the specific function's call, so that the animations would be slow enough for the user to see.
